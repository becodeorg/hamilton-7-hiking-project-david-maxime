Hello and welcome to our Hiking Manager app!

This project was made by David and Maxime as a group project for learning PHP.

You can register, login, logout, see a list of all hikes, add hikes, update them, modify your own hikes and add tags to them. You can also sort hikes by tags.

The admin dummy user is IsAdmin and the password is 1234. This will give you access to admin panel to be able to modify all hikes and to manage users and tags.

Enjoy!
